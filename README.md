# Bond_Angle_Force_Constant_Data
Data and current code for analysing distributions of periodic systems.  Files will be updated as regularly as possible but will have the same names, so its worth redownloading the whole repo

## Results formatting
Results are split primarily by ringstats, and so the numbers in the results folders 

### ringstats_lt0.out
Ringstats are contained in this file

| MC Temperature | Bond force constr | Angle force contr | Seed number | pn (0-Max allowed ring size) |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| -1800 | 900 | 500 | 1 | 0.0                 0.0                 0.0                 0.0                 0.0                 0.0                 1.0                 0.0                 0.0 |
